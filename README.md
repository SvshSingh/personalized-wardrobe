## Next steps for WARDROBE WIZARD

- Refining the prompt further is essential to achieve more accurate results.
- Currently, the app uses IndexedDB for client-side image storage and transmits images as form data between the client and server. Switching to cloud data storage will improve scalability.
- We intend to implement a user profile feature to collect specific details about each user. This information will be used to query the GPT Vision model, providing more personalized fashion suggestions tailored to individual users.
- We plan to integrate **Myntra's API** to offer additional suggestions for accessories and other missing items to enhance the user's look.
